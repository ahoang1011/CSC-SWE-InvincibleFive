Restaurant Food Donation Web App: "BOUNTY"

Through our system, we wanted to help reduce perfectly good food that is wasted and direct it towards feeding the hungry.
Charities in need of food donations will have the ability to post to a local restaurant newsfeed of their current food needs.
Restaurants can view multiple charity food requests and select the most relevant ones to donate their surplus food inventory.
An incentive for the restaurant is that they can write off their donations as tax deductions. Our app can serve as proof.
Restaurants and charities have the ability to view their previous transactions.
